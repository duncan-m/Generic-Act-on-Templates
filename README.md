Here are two templates I have regularly used with Act-on for landing pages and emails.

*Set-up*

1. Upload the images in the /images folder to your website/blog and note the URL
2. Update the URLs in the 'Responsive email' and 'Landing page' index.htm look for: [YOUR IMAGES URL] & [YOUR LOGO URL] in the template code
3. Update the title of the template to one of your choice, look for [YOUR TITLE] near the top
4. Update your social media links near the bottom
5. Upload the templates to Act-on (look for stationary section where you can upload templates
6. Select template name and they should work

*Customisation*

You can customise colours by playing with the colour codes in the template
